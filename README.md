Flumpdroid
==========

Android libraries for loading and playing animations generated by
[Flump](https://github.com/threerings/flump). For the most part, it is a fairly
direct port of the core bits, including some rudamentary DisplayObject
functionality mimicking the Flash API.

It doesn't yet bundle itself up for convenient use as a library, and is
in several areas still very much a proof-of-concept, but it contains an
app to demonstrate loading and displaying a handful of test cases.
